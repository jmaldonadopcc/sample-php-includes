# sample-php-includes

This is a quick and dirty working sample of PHP includes.

Nothing too fancy but it allows you to consolidate huge chunks of HTML and CSS code that repeat constantly throughout your project. Of course, sometimes those huge chunks have little pieces of data that need to change from page to page.

## Usage

Use is easy. Add more HTML as needed to your header.php and footer.php files. Then replicate the index.php file as needed but make sure to change the values of your variables and of course the page content to match that page.

## Things you can do

Here's some suggestions for things to do:

* You can add a small online form to the footer.php along with social media icons.
* Link the jQuery library in your header.php file if you need to use it. Add your page's working jQuery code to your footer.php file.
* Make your page's navigation, and add it to the header.php file.
* If you want all of your pages to have a different hero image in the header, write that value as something that echoes in your header.php file (inline stylesheet), then set the name of that hero image in your header.php file.
